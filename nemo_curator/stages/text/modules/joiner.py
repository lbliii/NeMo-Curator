@dataclass
class DocumentJoiner(ProcessingStage[DocumentBatch, DocumentBatch]):
    """
    Joins documents that have a common id back into a single document.
    The order of the documents is dictated by an additional segment_id column.
    A maximum length can be specified to limit the size of the joined documents.

    The joined documents are joined by a separator.

    This stage performs the inverse operation of DocumentSplitter, allowing you
    to reconstruct documents from their segments.

    Important:
        This stage assumes that all segments belonging to the same document are
        contained within a single DocumentBatch. Segments from the same document
        split across multiple batches will NOT be joined together. Ensure your
        batching logic keeps all segments of a document together.

    Example:
        If you have segments with document_id=1, segment_id=[0,1] and text=["Hello", "World"],
        they will be joined into a single row with document_id=1 and text="Hello\\n\\nWorld"
        (assuming separator="\\n\\n").

    Args:
        separator (str): The separator to join the documents on.
        text_field (str): The name of the column containing the text to join.
            Defaults to "text".
        segment_id_field (str): The name of the column containing the segment id.
            Defaults to "segment_id".
        document_id_field (str): The name of the column containing the document id.
            Defaults to "id".
        drop_segment_id_field (bool): Whether to drop the segment_id_field after joining.
            Defaults to True.
        max_length (int, optional): The maximum length of the joined documents.
            Both max_length and length_field must be specified or neither can be specified.
        length_field (str, optional): The name of the column containing the length of the documents.
            Both max_length and length_field must be specified or neither can be specified.
